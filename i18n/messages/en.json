        "text2": "When injected, Radiesse provides instant structural support due to its consistency while encouraging collagen production around the particles. This process stimulates cellular renewal, leading to a progressive improvement in skin appearance and lasting results that can last up to 18 months or more.",
        "page_title": "Radiesse",
        "page_text": "Radiesse is a dermal filler known for its ability to provide both immediate volume and long-term collagen stimulation. Made from calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) microspheres, Radiesse is injected into areas needing added structure, such as the cheeks, jawline, and hands. It provides a lifting effect while also encouraging the body to produce its own collagen, making it a popular choice for facial and hand rejuvenation.",

          "text1": "Dermal fillers can be categorized as natural or synthetic. Natural fillers such as Restylane and Juvéderm are hyaluronic acid-based and plump the skin by binding with water molecules. Radiesse is a synthetic filler that uses a two-pronged approach to plumping the skin and filling wrinkles. First, it uses calcium microspheres to add structure under the skin where collagen (the skin’s natural structural support) has dwindled. Second, it encourages the body to build new collagen around the injection areas to continue supporting the skin for up to one year.",
